===== High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs =====
coarse-to-fine generator
G1: global generator
G2: high res. uses info from G1
train G1 first, then train together

multi-scale discriminator
train on downscaled image (eg D1 D2 D3 where D3 gets the full image)

feature matching loss

===== Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs =====

add L1

talk: -d sucks, 
thresh: only use D when SSIM has been good enough (thresh1) for thresh2 iterations


grid search loss
