training gen first -> d can't learn
changed balance if D is too good or not good enough
make generator wait until D is good
mixing batch, and back
add a penalty for indecisiveness

D,G tested different loss functions and activations and BN


don't know if learning from D at all

promising: give G the old loss value, not updated discriminator
todo DCGAN (BCE), completely different batch
