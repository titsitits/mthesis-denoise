\section{Future work}
%- Discriminator loss
%needs to be much better
%- multi-scale (pix2pixHD)

- train a general network with specialized dataset

- WGAN

- batch same noise samples or samples from one image/noise at a time to take advantage of BN

further fine-tuning of the discriminator: eg BN before/after, lighter generator

PatchGAN needs carefully balanced loss because high frequencies
