====== TODO ======
Created Wednesday 21 November 2018

move losscrop to criterion for more flexibility
compare with MSE or MSEcombined

__Table of measurements (how is it trained, how is it validated)__
	compare w/psnr on training data


===== 1 =====
run: DnCNN, Redish w/ higher learning rate, compression (3), compression 60

quantitative test and graph (and test w/ compression)

compression test

implement a skip baseline
compare loss w/ bs, #layers, res
add compression
grapher
test w/o padding, check when grid takes place

share weights at the beginning

unsupervised denoising
reduce artifacts w/stride (and mirroring?)

investigate https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04026
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06766


===== Done =====
12/05/2018 and - overlapping training and testing, RedCNN, RedishCNN 
11/28/2018 overwrite, uncrop switches
test/train set maker
compare perf of finding noise vs clean image
kernel_size 5 fix RuntimeError
data augmentation 11/25/2018
script to reconstruct image	2018-11-23
x = find clean image rather than noise	2018-11-22
