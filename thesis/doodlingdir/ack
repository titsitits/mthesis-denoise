I would like to thank Christophe De Vleeschouwer for taking the time to meet with me every week, sharing a great deal of knowledge and ideas, and supporting my endeavors; Leslie Sanderson for proofreading my work and contributing to a happy and supportive work environment; and the Wikimedia Commons QI community for providing constructive criticism which helped me improve my photographic skills to the point where this master thesis is of great relevance to my interests.
