  abstract = 	 {We apply basic statistical reasoning to signal reconstruction by machine learning - learning to map corrupted observations to clean signals - with a simple and powerful conclusion: it is possible to learn to restore images by only looking at corrupted examples, at performance at and sometimes exceeding training using clean data, without explicit image priors or likelihood models of the corruption. In practice, we show that a single model learns photographic noise removal, denoising synthetic Monte Carlo images, and reconstruction of undersampled MRI scans - all corrupted by different processes - based on noisy data only.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a parallel distributed processing model with local space-invariant interconnections, which is more readily implemented by optics and is able to classify patterns correctly, even if they have been shifted or distorted. Error backpropagation is used as a training algorithm. Computer simulation results presented indicate that the processing is effective and the network can deal with the shifted or distorted patterns. Moreover, the optical implementation architecture using matched filters for the model is discussed.},
